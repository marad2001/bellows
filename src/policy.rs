         ## How to work\n\
         \n\
         Use the `tdd` skill: write failing tests first, then implement to green, then refactor.\n\
         The skill is available in your skills directory; invoke it before doing implementation work.\n\
         \n\
         ## Stop conditions\n\
         \n\
         Stop only when `cargo test` is green and your changes satisfy every acceptance criterion in the brief above.\n\
         Do NOT write a `.bellows-stub-marker` (or any other marker) file — the slice-2 stub agent is gone; only your real changes should appear in the resulting commit.\n\
         \n\
         When you are done, write a PR description body to `/workspace/.bellows-pr-description.md` summarising what you built, mapping each new test to the brief's acceptance criteria.\n"
